I started this project because the RGB.NET PicoPi uf2 didn't work for me at all. The only part that worked was using Zadig to make the device reachable (lol).

ArtemisRGB allows you to use a Pi Pico in place of a NodeMCU (sketch provided by DarthAffe). Deconstructing that sketch, and a lot of debugging later... The alpha version is brought to life.
